COOK BOOK
Introducing the concept of a web-based platform that leverages a chatbot powered by AI to offer personalized recipe suggestions based on users' available ingredients, dietary restrictions, and cuisine preferences.

Objective:
To simplify the process of finding recipes that match users' current pantry items and dietary needs, enhancing their cooking experience.

Target Audience:
• Home cooks looking for inspiration based on ingredients they already have.
• Individuals with dietary restrictions seeking suitable recipes.
• Culinary enthusiasts eager to explore new cuisines.

Key Features:
Intuitive Chatbot Interface:
• Develop a chatbot that users can interact with using natural language to input their available
ingredients, specify dietary restrictions, and express cuisine preferences.
• Implement AI and natural language processing (NLP) technologies to accurately understand and
respond to user queries.

Personalized Recipe Suggestions:
• Utilize an algorithm that matches user inputs with a comprehensive recipe database to suggest
recipes that closely match the users' current pantry items, dietary needs, and flavor
preferences.
• Provide options to filter and sort recipes by cooking time, difficulty level, and ratings.

Dietary and Allergen Filters:
• Include filters for common dietary restrictions and allergens (e.g., gluten-free, vegan, nut
allergies) to ensure users receive suitable recipes.
• Offer the ability to exclude specific ingredients from recipe suggestions.
Feedback and Rating System:
• Allow users to provide feedback on recipes and chatbot interactions, contributing to the
continuous improvement of AI accuracy and user satisfaction.
• Implement a rating system for users to evaluate recipes, helping others make informed
decisions based on community feedback.
